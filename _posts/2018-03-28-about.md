title:  About these notes
---

### Purpose

This website is aimed at keeping trace of notes on different modelling approaches that are used in unified models of segmentation and registration.

I've tried to break down the model in small pieces in order to be able to focus on the aim and practical implementation of each variable (it also leads to less cluttered notations). Obviously, when everyting is put together in the same model, there are some additional issues that arise ; in particular some variables that are assumed observed in the small pieces become latent variable, with a posterior distribution and thus uncertainty that must be taken into account.

For now, it is quite messy and only consists in an unordered collection of pages. I'll try to make it more organised in the future, if I find the motivation to keep writing notes.

### Who am I?

My name is YaÃ«l Balbastre, and I am a postdoctoral researcher in John Ashburner's [Computational Anatomy Group](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/Ashburner/) at the [Wellcome Centre for Human NeuroImaging](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk), UCL, London.
